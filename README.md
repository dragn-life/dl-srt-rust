# dl-srt-rust

Rust bindings for Haivision's SRT (Secure Reliable Transport) library, enabling low-latency video streaming in Rust applications.

## Status
ðŸš§ **Code provided as is. Working only on what I need.** ðŸš§

## Features

- Safe Rust wrapper around SRT's native C/C++ API
- Core SRT functionality including:
    - Socket creation and management

    - Data sending and receiving
    - Socket options handling
    - Error handling and status monitoring

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- SRT library (version 1.5.0 or higher)
    - Windows: Place `srt.dll` and `srt.lib` in the `lib` directory
